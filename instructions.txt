Hear we learning the git tutorial from sratch
 first of all after compatible software for system
 install it
then create new folder git-tutorial in any drive 
 if you created folder in drive with name "git tutorial "
  then copy the path of this perticular folder  
  
then open cmd prompt and then 
 C:\Users\ujjwa>cd E:\git tutorials
then open
 C:\Users\ujjwa> E:

 E:\git tutorials>
you get this interface now 
COPY THE 
E:\git tutorials>echo "# git-tutorials-" >> README.md
this will give you README.file

then run
 E:\git tutorials>git init
this will give the further output
Initialized empty Git repository in E:/git tutorials/.git/
and created the hidden folder.git 

so first of all you need to crate athutication which means 
you basically have to crate youre user-name and user-email
 for user- name and email the cammand is 
   git config --global user.name "John Doe"
   git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
why we do this 
after the commiting code this will ask you for authantication that time youre email has varifying
ok
then you have to check the status of repo by this cammand 
 E:\git tutorials>git status 
you get to see no commits at ans untracked files .this means that file has not tracked by git yet okay
then 
 E:\git tutorials>git add README.md 
 then you have to check status 
  E:\git tutorials>git status 
youll get 
	E:\git tutorials>git status
 On branch master

 No commits yet

 Changes to be committed:
   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README.md
and youre file has tracked and commited.

lets create our first commit 
 E:\git tutorials>git commit -m "this is the first commit"
and you get 
  E:\git tutorials>git commit -m "this is the first commit"
  [master (root-commit) 3c95a7a] this is the first commit
   1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
   create mode 100644 README.md 
ok
whenever you creating the repo you have branch which are basicall master and main 
E:\git tutorials>git branch
* master

E:\git tutorials>
i rename that perticuler branch name master to main branch 
hear an code for this 
E:\git tutorials>git branch -M main
which will change the name 
E:\git tutorials>git branch
* main
the name has succesfully changed
how i get know that my repo is linked with that main repo i have to create 
for this info you have to copy that github repo url and peast it to by using this command 
E:\git tutorials>git remote add origin https://github.com/Ujwal135/git-tutorials-.git
it means you tell to git : this is the place you need to commit 
for checking this add or not at our origin

E:\git tutorials>git remote add origin https://github.com/Ujwal135/git-tutorials-.git

E:\git tutorials>git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Ujwal135/git-tutorials-.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Ujwal135/git-tutorials-.git (push)
yes its done 
now simple stage is remains it is nothing but push this will
push youre changes in repos and ask you for authauntication and youre repo is successfullu done 
okk done till now 
if i have to modify my README.md file i modify it and 
the check status u seen 
E:\git tutorials>git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


if you have to change you use "git add" or no changes you can "git restore"
so i not restore fill i modified it (tell me in comments what i modified)

lets add this instruction file in our repository first of i save this 
you can add any file in repo by using this cmd  for eg i have created 
this txt file instruction in my repo folder and brodcast it in my repo
ok 
so 
E:\git tutorials>git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        instructions.txt


E:\git tutorials>git add .
hear you see . add this means both changes is accepeted 
and after work done dont check to forget commit and cheking the status 
***thank you***
